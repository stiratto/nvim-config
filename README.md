This is my NVIM config, it's made to run on potato computers, it runs on mine so I doubt yours is worse than mine, to be honest.

It uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) to manage plugins easily.

# Plugins
- nvim-lsp
- nvim-cmp 
- mason
- gruvbox
- telescope
- treesitter
- alpha-nvim (to style dashboards)
- null-ls
- luasnip
- and others
